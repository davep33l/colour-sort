# COLOUR SORT

Colour Sort is a single player endless sorting game. It has increasingly difficult game levels to keep the player engaged and coming back for more. The aim of the game is to sort the shuffled stacks of blocks in to stacks of the same colour, which triggers a new game to start and increases the level.
